# GeoLife-Trajectories
Final Project Data Analytics and IoT
Our goal is to build a model that can use this data set https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367
and predict the time forecasted in a location and tell us the number of devices available in that location, which means the traffic at that proximity location.
The first part is extracting data from the dataset since creating the CSV file would be over 2.5 GB we decided to let the user download the dataset 
and just run our code to obtain their dataset.
also we have saved our model and you can just load our trained model to try it youself. instructions are given in the jupyter notebook.
